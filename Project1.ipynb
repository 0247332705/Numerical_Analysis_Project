    "The differential equations arising from real-life systems are sometimes \"stiff\", which make problems especially hard to solve. One definition of a stiff IVP is the following\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial-value ODE problem is stiff if the step size needed to maintain absolute stability of the forward Euler method is much smaller than the step size needed to represent the solution accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we propose to analyze some properties of such systems and design specific numerical methods to solve them. We will see for example that classical Runge-Kutta methods are not very efficient solvers in this context. You will focus on three situations of increasing complexity, that will allow you to experiment and discover numerical properties of stiff systems, and understand their underlying difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write a small project report that shows your results, and summarize your findings. For the evaluation I will pay attention to the quality of the interpretations, how you apply the algorithms and the quality of the numerical illustrations. It does not need to be long: I will prefer a short summary that shows that you have understood and analyzed the methods."

    "##Â Appendix: adaptive time stepping strategy - embedded Runge-Kutta\n",
    "The idea is to adapt the time step to the local dynamics in order to provide an efficient integration strategy. The user should provide a tolerance and the adaptation has to rely on an error estimate and should produce a time step so that the local error estimate is below the given tolerance. The idea to provide such an error estimate is to combine two methods with different orders such that the difference between the two is a conservative error estimate. However, building up a lower order method from a given one, should not result in an important increase of the computational effort. Thus the idea of embedded methods in order to minimize the number of function evaluations, and consequently the computational effort. We will rely on the a Runge-Kutta of order 4 with 4 stages, known as the $3 / 8$ rule and will construct a 3 rd order embedded method. Starting from the $k_i$ values, $i=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, obtained\n",
